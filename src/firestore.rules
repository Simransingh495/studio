/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for BloodSync.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles.
 * Blood requests and donation matches are accessible with certain restrictions based on user roles and relationships.
 * Notifications are stored in a central collection, but users can only read their own.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Only the authenticated user can read/write their own profile. Authenticated users can list other users to find donors.
 * - /bloodRequests/{bloodRequestId}: Stores blood requests. Any authenticated user can create or read a blood request. Only the user who created the request can update or delete it.
 * - /donationMatches/{donationMatchId}: Stores donation matches.  Any authenticated user can create a donation match. Only the involved users can update.
 * - /donations/{donationId}: Stores donation records. Authenticated users can create donations. Users can only read their own donations.
 * - /notifications/{notificationId}: Stores notifications for all users. Users can only read their own. Any authenticated user can create a notification for another user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Data validation is limited to ensuring ownership and relational integrity.
 * - Denormalization is used to avoid expensive `get()` calls in security rules where possible, but `get()` is used for critical ownership checks.
 * - In this prototyping mode, data shape validation is relaxed to allow for rapid schema iteration.
