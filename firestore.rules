/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for BloodSync.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and notifications.
 * Blood requests and donation matches are accessible with certain restrictions based on user roles and relationships.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Only the authenticated user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /bloodRequests/{bloodRequestId}: Stores blood requests. Any authenticated user can create a blood request. Only the user who created the request can update or delete it.
 * - /donationMatches/{donationMatchId}: Stores donation matches.  Any authenticated user can create a donation match. No updates or deletes are allowed.
 * - /users/{userId}/notifications/{notificationId}: Stores notifications for a specific user. Only the user can read/write their own notifications.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled to protect user privacy.
 * - Data validation is limited to ensuring ownership and relational integrity.
 * - Denormalization is used to avoid expensive `get()` calls in security rules.
 * - In this prototyping mode, data shape validation is relaxed to allow for rapid schema iteration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - BloodRequest documents contain a `userId` field, which is used to enforce ownership for updates and deletes.
 * - DonationMatch documents contain `requestId` and `donorId` fields to establish relationships and simplify authorization.
